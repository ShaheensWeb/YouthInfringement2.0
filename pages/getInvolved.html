				<img src="images/rule-teal.png" />
				<p>We are now accepting script submissions for our 2015 festival! Are you a scriptwriter between the ages of 15 and 25? Do you have a story that you want to share? Is it epic? Is it comedic? Is it tragic? We want to see it! Your script could be directed, stage managed, performed, and designed by young, local artists at Arts Court Theatre in Ottawa. If your script is selected, it will be workshopped by local, professional dramaturges and will potentially be performed in our annual festival. </p>
                <p>We accept all genres and all types of scripts. Don't be shy! Pour your heart out onto the page, or crack jokes for 45 pages straight. We don't mind, we want to see everything!</p>

		<p>"As an actor in last year's Festival, I learned a lot about theatre and developed great relationships with other young artists. The festival is a great way for new and experienced actors to get out into the public eye and show their talents while working with some of the best people in the business." </p>
