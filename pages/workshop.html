	<h2>David Coleman</h2>
	<p>I was born in Ottawa and have lived here the majority of my life. Writing manifested as a passion of mine almost over night when I was thirteen and I've been doing it ever since. Though I did attend school it was for Chef training, writing and acting are simply two things I've always pursued on the side. This'll be my third year involved in Youth Infringement and I'm hoping it will be just as memorable as the previous two. Dave "Thor" Coleman.</p>

The Grim Reaper hasn’t had a decent laugh in a while thanks to recent advances in medicine, and John and Molly might just be the answer – even if it costs them their souls.</p>
