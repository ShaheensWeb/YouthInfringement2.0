# YouthInfringement2.0
This website is a recreation (near identical) of http://youthinfringement.ca/

The Youth Infringement The annual Youth Infringement Festival is a creative outlet for young artists 
between the ages of 15 and 25 to create and perform live theatre in a professional setting. Directors,
actors, writers and stage managers are picked from Ottawa youth to put together a unique showcase of theatre 
in Downtown Ottawa at the Arts Court Theatre.

After having issues locating there web developper I stitched together this solution that I will redirect to the current domain
which uses Angular.JS & $routeProvider specficially to provide much faster load time thanks to two way data binding and ajax
calls to allow us to only replace the inner body of each html page avoiding the reloading of all header and footer elements
upon every page switch.

This project is a collaboration, but so far all work has been done by yours truely.
